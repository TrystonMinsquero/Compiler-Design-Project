# Cflat

### Like Csharp, but worse!

This is a project I made for my Compiler Design class for my Undergrad for Computer Science at UTD. We were required to use Java but I had a lot of fun on this. It was two part and you can see the grammar we required to implement in [part 1](<Project Assignment 1.pdf>) and [part 2](<Project Assignment 2.pdf>), as well as the release for each turn in.

### Build Instructions

simply just use the make file to build with `make run` ro just `make`.
